# Spring Boot and React Application

This project is a full-stack application that combines a Spring Boot backend with a React frontend. Below are the instructions for setting up and running both parts of the application.

## Project Structure

```

└── README.md             # Overall project documentation
```

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Ensure you have Java and Maven installed.
3. Run the following command to build the backend:
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```
4. Start the Spring Boot application:
   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
5. The backend will be running on `http://localhost:8081`.

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the React application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
5. The frontend will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Conclusion

This project provides a basic structure for a full-stack application using Spring Boot and React. You can expand upon this foundation by adding more features and components as needed.
